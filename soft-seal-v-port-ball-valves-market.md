<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soft Seal V Port Ball Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flangedless</li><li>Flanged</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soft seal V port ball valves are available in two main market types: flangedless and flanged. Flangedless V port ball valves do not have traditional flanges for connection, making them more compact and suitable for small spaces. These valves are typically used in applications where space is limited or where flanges are not necessary. On the other hand, flanged V port ball valves have traditional flanges for easy connection to pipelines or equipment. These valves are commonly used in larger industrial applications where a secure and leak-proof connection is required.</p></p>
