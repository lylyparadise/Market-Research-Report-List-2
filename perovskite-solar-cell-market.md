<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Perovskite Solar Cell Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Structure</li><li>Inverted Structure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Perovskite solar cells can be categorized into two main types based on their structure: normal structure and inverted structure. In normal structure cells, the electron-transport layer is positioned closer to the electrode, while in inverted structure cells, the hole-transport layer is closer to the electrode. Normal structure cells are easier to fabricate and have shown higher efficiencies, while inverted structure cells have the potential for improved stability and durability. Both types have their own advantages and are being increasingly researched for commercial applications.</p></p>
