<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Turbine Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Yaw Brakes</li><li>Rotor Brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wind turbine brakes play a crucial role in the safe and efficient operation of wind turbines. There are two main types of brakes used in wind turbines: yaw brakes and rotor brakes. Yaw brakes are responsible for controlling the direction of the turbine, ensuring it faces into the wind for optimal energy production. Rotor brakes, on the other hand, are used to slow down or stop the rotation of the blades in case of high winds or maintenance needs. Both types of brakes are essential for ensuring the overall reliability and performance of wind turbines.</p></p>
