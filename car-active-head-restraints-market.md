<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Active Head Restraints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Headrest Activation</li><li>Seat Back Activation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Car Active Head Restraints come in two main types: Headrest Activation and Seat Back Activation. Headrest Activation systems are triggered when a crash sensor detects a collision, causing the head restraint to move forward and provide support to the occupant's head. On the other hand, Seat Back Activation systems use the forward movement of the seat back during a collision to automatically adjust the position of the head restraint for improved safety and protection. Both types of systems aim to reduce the risk of whiplash and other neck injuries in car accidents.</p></p>
