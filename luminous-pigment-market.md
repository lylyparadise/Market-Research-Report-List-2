<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The luminous Pigment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Luminous Coatings</li><li>Fluorescent Coatings</li><li>Phosphorescent Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The luminous pigment market includes three main types of coatings: self-luminous coatings, fluorescent coatings, and phosphorescent coatings. Self-luminous coatings are able to emit light without an external light source, providing continuous illumination. Fluorescent coatings absorb ultraviolet light and re-emit it in visible light, producing bright and vibrant colors. Phosphorescent coatings store light energy when exposed to a light source and slowly release it over time, creating a glowing effect in the dark. Each type of coating offers unique properties and applications in various industries.</p></p>
