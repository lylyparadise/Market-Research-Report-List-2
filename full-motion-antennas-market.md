<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Full Motion Antennas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Full Motion Antennas come in two main types in the market: Active and Passive. Active antennas require an external power source to amplify and boost the signals they receive, making them more powerful and capable of long-range reception. On the other hand, Passive antennas do not require a power source and rely solely on the signals they receive from the transmission tower. Passive antennas are typically simpler and more cost-effective than active antennas, but may have a shorter range and weaker signal reception capabilities.</p></p>
