<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impeller Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Manual</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Impeller humidifiers come in two main types: automatic and manual. Automatic impeller humidifiers are equipped with sensors that detect the humidity level in the room and adjust the output accordingly. They are convenient and require minimal maintenance. On the other hand, manual impeller humidifiers need to be adjusted manually to control the humidity level. They are more cost-effective but require regular monitoring to ensure the desired humidity level is maintained. Both types are effective in adding moisture to the air and improving indoor air quality.</p></p>
