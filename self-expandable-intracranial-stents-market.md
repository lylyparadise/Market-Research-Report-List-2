<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self expandable Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Stents</li><li>Closed-Loop Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-expandable intracranial stents are devices used in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. There are two main types of self-expandable intracranial stents: open loop stents and closed-loop stents. Open loop stents are flexible devices that can conform to the shape of the blood vessel, while closed-loop stents are more rigid and provide greater support. Both types of stents are used to treat intracranial aneurysms by diverting blood flow away from the aneurysm and preventing it from rupturing.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Self expandable Intracranial Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-expandable intracranial stents are used in the treatment of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes by providing structural support to blood vessels in the brain. In ischemic strokes, the stents help to restore blood flow by opening up blocked arteries. In hemorrhagic strokes, they help to reinforce weakened vessel walls and prevent further bleeding. These stents offer a minimally invasive treatment option for patients at risk of stroke, improving outcomes and reducing the risk of complications.</p></p>
