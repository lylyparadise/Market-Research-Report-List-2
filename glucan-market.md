<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glucan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soluble</li><li>Insoluble</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glucans, a type of dietary fiber, can be classified into two main categories: soluble and insoluble. Soluble glucans dissolve in water and form a gel-like substance in the digestive tract, helping to slow down digestion and promote feelings of fullness. This type of glucan is commonly found in foods like oats, barley, and legumes. On the other hand, insoluble glucans do not dissolve in water and instead add bulk to the stool, promoting regular bowel movements. Sources of insoluble glucans include whole grains and vegetables. Both types of glucans offer various health benefits, such as improving cholesterol levels and aiding in digestion.</p></p>
