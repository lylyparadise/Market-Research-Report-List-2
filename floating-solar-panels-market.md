<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floating Solar Panels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solar-tracking floating solar panels</li><li>Stationary floating solar panels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Floating solar panels are a unique way to harness solar energy, with two main types on the market. Solar-tracking floating panels are designed to move throughout the day to optimize sun exposure and maximize energy production. On the other hand, stationary floating panels remain in a fixed position on the water surface. Both types offer advantages, with solar-tracking panels being more efficient but also more expensive, while stationary panels are simpler and more cost-effective. Overall, floating solar panels provide a versatile and environmentally friendly solution for generating clean energy.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Floating Solar Panels Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-shore Floating Solar Panels</li><li>On-shore Floating Solar Panels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Floating solar panels are a growing market application that includes off-shore and on-shore installations. Off-shore floating solar panels are placed on bodies of water such as lakes, reservoirs, and oceans, providing renewable energy while minimizing land use. On-shore floating solar panels are installed on water bodies near shorelines, offering similar benefits as off-shore installations but with easier access for maintenance and connection to power grids. Both applications contribute to increasing solar energy capacity and reducing carbon emissions.</p></p>
