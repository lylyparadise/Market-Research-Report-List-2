<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Basic CBTC</li><li>I-CBTC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) is a signaling system used in the railway industry to control trains based on communication between the train and the trackside equipment. There are two main types of CBTC markets: Basic CBTC and I-CBTC. Basic CBTC systems use continuous communication between the train and trackside equipment to ensure safe train operations. On the other hand, I-CBTC systems use intermittent communication for train control, offering more flexibility and advanced features compared to Basic CBTC. Both types aim to improve safety, efficiency, and capacity in railway operations.</p></p>
