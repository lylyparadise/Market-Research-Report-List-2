<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EUV Photoresist Developer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist Developer</li><li>Negative Photoresist Developer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive photoresist developer is used in lithography process where the exposed areas of the photoresist are developed. This type of developer removes the unexposed areas, leaving behind the desired pattern for further processing. Negative photoresist developer, on the other hand, removes the exposed areas of the photoresist, creating a pattern in the unexposed areas. Both types of developers play a crucial role in the production of semiconductor devices and other microelectronics applications, catering to different patterning requirements.</p></p>
