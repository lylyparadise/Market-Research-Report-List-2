<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sand Aluminum Casting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Green Sand</li><li>Dry Sand</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Green sand casting involves using a mixture of sand, clay, water, and additives to create a mold for casting aluminum. This method is cost-effective and versatile, making it popular for a wide range of applications. Dry sand casting, on the other hand, uses dry sand to create the mold, which is then baked to harden before the aluminum is poured. While this method requires more time and resources, it results in a more precise and smooth finish, making it ideal for complex shapes and designs.</p></p>
