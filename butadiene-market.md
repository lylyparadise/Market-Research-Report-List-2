<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Butadiene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extractive Distillation</li><li>Oxidative Dehydrogenation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extractive distillation and oxidative dehydrogenation are two common types of processes used in the butadiene market. Extractive distillation utilizes a solvent to separate butadiene from other components in the feed stream, allowing for higher purity levels. On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation involves the use of oxygen to selectively remove hydrogen atoms from butadiene, resulting in the formation of butadiene without the need for traditional cracking methods. Both processes have their advantages and are utilized in different scenarios based on specific market demands.</p></p>
