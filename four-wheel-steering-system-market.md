<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Four-wheel Steering System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crab Steering</li><li>Passive Rear Wheel Steering</li><li>Articulated Steering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are three main types of four-wheel steering systems: Crab Steering, Passive Rear Wheel Steering, and Articulated Steering. Crab Steering allows the vehicle to move diagonally by turning all four wheels in the same direction. Passive Rear Wheel Steering activates the rear wheels to turn slightly in the same direction as the front wheels at higher speeds for improved stability. Articulated Steering involves separate steering controls for the front and rear wheels, enabling tighter turns and better maneuverability in tight spaces.</p></p>
