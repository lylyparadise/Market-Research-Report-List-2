<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coffee Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Pressed Oils</li><li>CO2/Solvent Extraction Oils</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cold pressed oils are extracted from coffee beans using mechanical pressure, without the use of heat or chemicals. These oils are considered more natural and retain more of the coffee bean's original flavors and aromas. On the other hand, CO2 or solvent extraction oils are obtained using carbon dioxide or chemical solvents to extract the oil from the beans. These methods may result in higher yields but can also remove some of the coffee bean's natural characteristics.</p></p>
